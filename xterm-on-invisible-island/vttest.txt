NAME
       vttest - test VT100-type terminal

SYNOPSIS
       vttest [options] [24x80.132]

DESCRIPTION
       Vttest  is  a  program  designed  to  test the functionality of a VT100
       terminal (or emulator thereof).  It tests both display (escape sequence
       handling) and keyboard.

       The   program  is  menu-driven  and  contains  full  on-line  operating
       instructions.

       o   To run a given menu-item, you must enter its number.

       o   Menu items start at zero; this is the "Exit"  item  in  almost  all
           cases.

       o   You  can  run  all  menu-items  (for  a given level) by entering an
           asterisk, i.e, "*'.

       o   You can force a repaint of the menu items by entering "?".

       o   A few menus can be more than one page.  Use "n" and "p"  to  switch
           to the next or previous page.

OPTIONS
       You can specify the screen geometry in the form [24x80.132], i.e.,

       o   24 lines,

       o   80 minimum columns, and

       o   132 maximum columns.

       If  your  terminal  does  not switch between 80 and 132 columns you may
       specify 24x80.80, for example, to avoid a misleading display.

       Other options are:

       -V   print the program version, and exit.

       -c commands
            replay commands recorded by the logging option.  Some keyboard and
            mouse  input  is  required,  depending on the tests, but otherwise
            menu selection and next-page responses are automated.

       -f fontfile
            specify a file  containing  a  DRCS  (soft  character  definition)
            string.

       -l   log test results to vttest.log.

       -p   use padding, e.g., for a VT100 connected to a high-speed line.

       -q   show  only  the  most  recent part of a continuous response, e.g.,
            any-event mouse tests, to improve readability of the test.

       -s   add time-delay  in  selected  panning/scrolling  options  to  show
            details.

       -u   suppress  switch  from  UTF-8  mode on startup, and enable a third
            setting in the 7-bit/8-bit parsing test to allow for  C2  controls
            as an alternate to 8-bit C1.

       -8   use 8-bit controls (this can be changed with a menu option).

ENVIRONMENT
       When  vttest  starts, it checks the locale (LC_ALL, etc.), to determine
       if the terminal uses UTF-8,  and  normally  switches  the  terminal  to
       ISO-8859 1.  Use the "-u" option to disable this switching, and provide
       some special cases where UTF-8 encoding is accepted.

       For  example,  the  Unicode  specification  does   not   document   its
       relationship to ECMA-48 (ISO 6429) beyond listing C0 and C1 codes which
       Unicode treats  as  whitespace.   The  latter  (i.e.,  NEL  U+0085)  is
       misleading  because  Unicode  describes C1 controls only obliquely.  It
       goes into a little more detail regarding ECMA-35  (ISO  2022).   vttest
       allows  for  both  the  standard  encoding  of C1 (single byte) and the
       variant implied by Unicode, referred to  here  as  C2  (two  bytes)  to
       distinguish the two encodings.
